Although newborns initially lack the bacteria responsible, exposure can occur through shared items such as pacifiers.Baby Bottle Tooth Decay: The continual consumption of sugary beverages from a bottle can have detrimental effects on teeth, including permanent ones.Prevention: - Once teeth start appearing, establish a daily cleaning routine, especially before bedtime. Utilize a soft, small-headed brush and child-friendly fluoride toothpaste. - Regulate sugar intake and delay introducing the 'sweet' taste. - Avoid prolonged bottle-sucking (which immerses teeth in sugar). Note: Orange juice and milk also contain sugar. - For those with a higher susceptibility to cavities, considering Zymafluor@ 0.25 mg tablets might be beneficial. - For children aged six and above, using weekly fluoride gel can be advantageous."
