This involves immediate milk spitting, unchanged milk appearance, and no curdling or odor.Causes: Fast feeding, a tense environment, a larger nipple hole, excessive food intake, swallowing air, post-feeding movement.Treatment: Address the underlying trigger, elevate the bed head. Fennel tea might offer relief. Consider thickening infant milk with carob seed flour-containing products, aiding digestion and reducing reflux. Two approaches: adding to milk (while monitoring weight) or opting for ready-to-use thickened products.",
