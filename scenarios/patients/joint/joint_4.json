When infants under the age of one encounter severe diarrhea or vomiting, it's crucial to seek medical assistance due to the inherent risk of rapid fluid loss. It's noteworthy that breastfed infants and those consuming prebiotic-fiber formulas may exhibit stools with a looser consistency, which doesn't necessarily point to diarrhea. It's advisable to consider both the baby's dietary intake and the nature of their stools.Critical Symptoms: - Weight loss exceeding 5 percent of their body weight. - Manifestations of lethargy and rapid breathing. - Observable physical signs like sunken eyes, dry lips, pale skin, and a depressed fontanel (the soft spot on the head). - The presence of fever may indicate an underlying infection. - A lack of urination leading to dry diapers.Causes: - Factors related to food, encompassing consumption of uncommon or spoiled items, exposure to bacterial or viral agents, or the presence of worms. - Possible underlying digestive vulnerabilities, prematurity, metabolic conditions (such as gluten, lactose, or cow's milk intolerance), and a predisposition to allergies. - The potential influence of antibiotics on the gastrointestinal system. - Emotional stress and the process of teething.It's crucial to recognize that younger children are more prone to dehydration, which can escalate to serious consequences like coma. Swift medical attention is imperative."
