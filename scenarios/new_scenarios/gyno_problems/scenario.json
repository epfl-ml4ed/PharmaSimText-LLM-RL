Consider diet and stool consistency.Critical Symptoms:- Weight loss over 5 percent.- Apathy, fast breathing.- Sunken eyes, dry lips, pale skin, fontanel depression.- Fever indicates infection.- No urination (dry diapers).Causes:- Food issues: unusual or spoiled food, bacteria, viruses, worms.- Digestive weakness, prematurity, metabolic issues (gluten, lactose, cow's milk intolerance), allergy tendency.- Antibiotics' effects.- Emotional stress, teething.Remember, younger children dehydrate faster, risking coma and worse.
