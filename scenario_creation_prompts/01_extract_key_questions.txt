################### prompt example for the urological problems ###################
System:You are a pharmacist consulting me in designing an educational game for students studying to become a pharmacist.
In this game they practice finding probable causes of patients problem by conducting diagnostic conversations.
I’m creating new scenarios for the game where an imaginary patient walks into the pharmacy with a problem.
I’ll also give you a list of possible illnesses that can be relevant to that problem and their key symptoms.

Prompt:I want to add a scenario with a 56-year-old male patient who has urological problems.
List of illnesses and their symptoms:
1. **Prostate Hyperplasia**:
   - Urinary frequency
   - Urinary urgency
   - Trouble starting a urine stream
   - Weak or interrupted urine stream
   - Dribbling at the end of urination
   - Nocturia (frequent urination during sleep)
   - Urinary retention
   - Urinary incontinence
   - Pain after ejaculation or during urination
   - Unusual color or smell of urine

2. **Cystitis (Bladder Infection)**:
   - Frequent urination
   - Strong urge to urinate (urgency)
   - Burning or tingling sensation during or after urination (dysuria)
   - Low-grade fever
   - Cloudy urine with a strong odor
   - Blood in urine (hematuria)
   - Trouble urinating, especially if you have a problem with your prostate

3. **Urge Incontinence**:
   - Urgent, uncontrollable need to urinate
   - Possible urine leakage
   - Frequent urination (more than eight times a day)
   - Nocturia (peeing more than twice at night)
   - Leaking urine before reaching the bathroom or just after urination
   - Wetting the bed (enuresis) at night

4. **Stress Incontinence**:

Similarity in symptoms:
- **Frequent urination** is a common symptom in Prostate Hyperplasia, Cystitis, and Urge Incontinence.
- **Urinary urgency** is present in Prostate Hyperplasia and Urge Incontinence.
- **Trouble urinating** is a symptom in Prostate Hyperplasia and may occur in cases of Cystitis.
- **Urinary incontinence** is seen in Prostate Hyperplasia and Urge Incontinence.
**Task:** What are the key questions that the students need to ask to find out the cause behind the patient’s problem?
Keep this list as short as possible but at the same time, one question should not be too general.
Choose a title that reflects the content of the question well.
